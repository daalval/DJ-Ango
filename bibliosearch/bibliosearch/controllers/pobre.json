      "abstract":"In this paper, a RF front-end of the 5.8 GHz integrated CMOS dedicated short range communication (DSRC) transceiver for the Korea/Japan electronic toll collection system is presented. The receiver uses low-IF conversion architecture for high sensitivity and low-power consumption while the transmitter uses direct up-conversion architecture for its simple structure and reliability. To solve image problem in the low-IF receiver, 10 MHz IF and 40 MHz IF are chosen for Korean and Japanese DSRC standards, respectively, since they make no image signals exist in image band. A single-quadrature mixer with the proposed transconductor-type quadrature generator in RF signal path is also adopted which has accurate quadrature characteristic in 5.8 GHz frequency. When the RF front-end of the integrated 5.8 GHz DSRC transceiver is implemented using 0.13 Î¼m CMOS technology, the receiver achieves the overall noise figure of less than 5 dB with image rejection ratio of more than 30 dB, and the transmitter carries an output peak power of 10 dBm with the adjacent channel power ratio of -43 dBc. The RF front-end of the 5.8 GHz DSRC transceiver dissipates 45 mA with 1.2 V supply voltage and 142 mA with 1.2/3.3 V dual supply voltage during RXand TX-modes, respectively.",

      "abstract":"In this letter, we investigate the performance of algebraic gossip algorithms for information dissemination in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). In the gossip algorithms, in each time slot, each node communicates with a neighboring node, which is randomly selected by an Exchange algorithm, to exchange their information. The goal of the algorithm is to efficiently disseminate all the messages to all the nodes as fast as possible. We analyze the convergence time of network coding (NC) based gossip algorithm by taking into account the node mobility in MANETs, and derived a lower bound on the convergence time. It showed that the convergence time of the NC gossip algorithm with node mobility can be reduced by the order of O(n1/2/log3/2n) over that without considering node mobility. But it is only O(log n) quicker than the gossip algorithm with node mobility but no NC.",

In real-world applications, such an emergency scheduling problem often involves multiple objectives, complex constraints, inherent uncertainty, and limited response time requirement. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy multiobjective optimization problem of rescue task scheduling, the aim of which is to simultaneously maximize the task scheduling efficiency and minimize the operation risk for the rescue team. We then develop an efficient multiobjective biogeography-based optimization (EMOBBO) algorithm for solving the problem. To cope with the uncertainty, we employ three correlated fuzzy ranking criteria, and use the concept of fuzzy dominance for comparing the dominance relation of solutions. In EMOBBO, we define new migration and mutation operators for effectively evolving the permutation-based solutions, use a problem-specific solution rearrangement mechanism for filtering out inefficient solutions, and employ a local neighborhood structure to suppress premature convergence. Computational experiments show that the proposed EMOBBO algorithm outperforms some state-of-the-art evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms, and our algorithm has been successfully applied to several real-world disaster rescue operations in recent years.",

      "abstract":"In systems neuroscience, it is becoming increasingly common to record the activity of hundreds of neurons simultaneously via electrode arrays. The ability to accurately measure the causal interactions among multiple neurons in the brain is crucial to understanding how neurons work in concert to generate specific brain functions. The development of new statistical methods for assessing causal influence between spike trains is still an active field of neuroscience research. Here, we suggest a copula-based Granger causality measure for the analysis of neural spike train data. This method is built upon our recent work on copula Granger causality for the analysis of continuous-valued time series by extending it to point-process neural spike train data. The proposed method is therefore able to reveal nonlinear and high-order causality in the spike trains while retaining all the computational advantages such as model-free, efficient estimation, and variability assessment of Granger causality. The performance of our algorithm can be further boosted with time-reversed data. Our method performed well on extensive simulations, and was then demonstrated on neural activity simultaneously recorded from primary visual cortex of a monkey performing a contour detection task.",

This paper proposes a mathematical model to reconstruct geometric network dynamics by combining the node movements within the network and topological changes engendered by these nodes. The network topology in the model is determined by a modified optimization procedure from the work (Lemarchand, et al. 2014) which minimizes the total length taking into account both degree and angle constraints, beyond the conditions of connectedness and planarity. A novel feature for solving our optimization problem is the use of âliftedâ angle constraints, which allows one to considerably reduce the solution runtimes. Using this optimization technique and a Langevin approach for the branching node movement, the simulated network dynamics represent the ER network dynamics observed under latrunculin B treated condition and recaptures features such as the appearance/disappearance of loops within the ER under the native condition. The proposed modeling approach allows quantitative comparison of networks between the model and experimental data based on topological changes induced by node dynamics. An increased temporal resolution of experimental data will allow a more detailed comparison of network dynamics using this modeling approach.",

Secret Sharing, a cryptographic primitive for the distribution of a secret among a group of n participants designed so that only subsets of shareholders of cardinality 0 <; t â¤ n are allowed to reconstruct the secret by pooling their shares, can help mitigating and minimizing the problem. A desirable feature of Secret Sharing schemes is cheater detection, i.e., the ability to detect one or more malicious shareholders trying to reconstruct the secret by obtaining legal shares from the other shareholders while providing them with fake shares. Verifiable Secret Sharing schemes solve this problem by allowing shareholders verifying the others' shares. We present new verification algorithms providing arbitrary secret sharing schemes with cheater detection capabilities, and prove their space efficiency with regard to other schemes appeared in the literature. We also introduce, in one of our schemes, the Exponentiating Polynomial Root Problem (EPRP), which is believed to be NP-Intermediate and therefore difficult.",

In this paper, we focus on the performance optimization of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) using the meta-scheduling paradigm to achieve an improved job scheduling across multiple clouds. We propose a novel inter-cloud job scheduling framework and implement policies to optimize performance of participating clouds. The framework, named as Inter-Cloud Meta-Scheduling (ICMS), is based on a novel message exchange mechanism to allow optimization of job scheduling metrics. The resulting system offers improved flexibility, robustness and decentralization. We implemented a toolkit named âSimulating the Inter-Cloudâ (SimIC) to perform the design and implementation of different inter-cloud entities and policies in the ICMS framework. An experimental analysis is produced for job executions in inter-cloud and a performance is presented for a number of parameters such as job execution, makespan, and turnaround times. The results highlight that the overall performance of individual clouds for selected parameters and configuration is improved when these are brought together under the proposed ICMS framework.",

The data compromise may occur due to attacks by other users and nodes within the cloud. Therefore, high security measures are required to protect data within the cloud. However, the employed security strategy must also take into account the optimization of the data retrieval time. In this paper, we propose division and replication of data in the cloud for optimal performance and security (DROPS) that collectively approaches the security and performance issues. In the DROPS methodology, we divide a file into fragments, and replicate the fragmented data over the cloud nodes. Each of the nodes stores only a single fragment of a particular data file that ensures that even in case of a successful attack, no meaningful information is revealed to the attacker. Moreover, the nodes storing the fragments, are separated with certain distance by means of graph T-coloring to prohibit an attacker of guessing the locations of the fragments. Furthermore, the DROPS methodology does not rely on the traditional cryptographic techniques for the data security; thereby relieving the system of computationally expensive methodologies. We show that the probability to locate and compromise all of the nodes storing the fragments of a single file is extremely low. We also compare the performance of the DROPS methodology with 10 other schemes. The higher level of security with slight performance overhead was observed.",

      "abstract":"We propose a methodology for model-based fault detection and diagnosis for stochastic Boolean dynamical systems indirectly observed through a single time series of transcriptomic measurements using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. The fault detection consists of an innovations filter followed by a fault certification step, and requires no knowledge about the possible system faults. The innovations filter uses the optimal Boolean state estimator, called the Boolean Kalman Filter (BKF). In the presence of knowledge about the possible system faults, we propose an additional step of fault diagnosis based on a multiple model adaptive estimation (MMAE) method consisting of a bank of BKFs running in parallel. Performance is assessed by means of false detection and misdiagnosis rates, as well as average times until correct detection and diagnosis. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is demonstrated via numerical experiments using a p53-MDM2 negative feedback loop Boolean network with stuck-at faults that model molecular events commonly found in cancer.",

On top of the classic Markov chain model, we proposed in this paper a feasible multi-order Markov chain based framework for anomaly detection. In this approach, both the high-order Markov chain and multivariate time series are adopted to compose a scheme described in algorithms along with the training procedure in the form of statistical learning framework. To curb time and space complexity, the algorithms are designed and implemented with non-zero value table and logarithm values in initial and transition matrices. For validation, the series of system calls and the corresponding return values are extracted from classic Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) intrusion detection evaluation data set to form a two-dimensional test input set. The testing results show that the multi-order approach is able to produce more effective indicators: in addition to the absolute values given by an individual single-order model, the changes in ranking positions of outputs from different-order ones also correlate closely with abnormal behaviours.",

Computing efficiency of the grids is studied in several scenarios and new composite memristive structures are utilized in shortest path and maze-solving computations. The dependence of the computing medium behavior on the symmetry of both the underlying geometry and the employed devices, is validated through SPICE-level circuit simulations, which highlight important computing inefficiencies. Particular circuit-models of memristive connections enable precise mapping of the target application on the computing medium. Extraordinary functionalities emerge when novel memristive computing components, comprising different electrical characteristics from their structural elements, are introduced in the grid. Applying assisted-computation, by incorporating the concept of Ariadne's thread, leaded to better computing results, which could find application in routing and path computing problems.",

Based on the processing speed of MCC and the communication rate of 5G scheme, this system can monitor and locate patients in real time. Multiple base stations of the massive multiple input multiple output cooperate with each other to locate the patients using cross-location method. Then, a new direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm is proposed in the presence of unknown mutual coupling. The uncorrelated signals are first estimated using the estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique algorithm. Then, these estimators construct the manifold matrix of uncorrelated signals to estimate the mutual coupling coefficients. The information about uncorrelated signals and mutual coupling is eliminated based on oblique projection technique in order to estimate the DOAs of coherent signals using the original array. Finally, the DOAs of coherent signals are achieved based on sparse representation theory. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed algorithm.",

Because of the importance of privacy, many cloud storage encryption schemes have been proposed to protect data from those who do not have access. All such schemes assumed that cloud storage providers are safe and cannot be hacked; however, in practice, some authorities (i.e., coercers) may force cloud storage providers to reveal user secrets or confidential data on the cloud, thus altogether circumventing storage encryption schemes. In this paper, we present our design for a new cloud storage encryption scheme that enables cloud storage providers to create convincing fake user secrets to protect user privacy. Since coercers cannot tell if obtained secrets are true or not, the cloud storage providers ensure that user privacy is still securely protected.",

The circuit encodes these samples by the temporal difference between the onset times of two subsequent voltage jumps, which mimic action potentials of biological neurons. By combining elegantly concepts from renewal theory and analog very large scale integrated technology, the circuit is principally able to sample from arbitrary distributions of positive, real random variables. Moreover, these distributions can be defined online by the circuit-user in terms of an input current time-series, without the need to reconfigure the circuit. We show results from this circuit fabricated in a CMOS 0.35-Î¼m technology process. Random sampling is demonstrated for the uniform, exponential, and-by means of circuit simulation-also for a more complex bimodal distribution.",

However, the development is hampered by data privacy concerns: data owners no longer physically possess the storage of their data. In this work, we study the issue of privacy-preserving set-valued data publishing. Existing data privacy-preserving techniques (such as encryption, suppression, generalization) are not applicable in many real scenes, since they would incur large overhead for data query or high information loss. Motivated by this observation, we present a suite of new techniques that make privacy-aware set-valued data publishing feasible on hybrid cloud. On data publishing phase, we propose a data partition technique, named extended quasi-identifierpartitioning (EQI-partitioning), which disassociates record terms that participate in identifying combinations. This way the cloud server cannot associate with high probability a record with rare term combinations. We prove the privacy guarantee of our mechanism. On data querying phase, we adopt interactive differential privacy strategy to resist privacy breaches from statistical queries. We finally evaluate its performance using real-life data sets on our cloud test-bed. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the validity and practicality of the proposed scheme.",

      "abstract":"Wireless body area networks (WBANs) consist of many small low-power sensors, through which users could monitor the real-time parameters of patients' physiology remotely. This capability could improve medical care and the monitoring of patients. WBAN devices typically have limited computing, storage, power, and communication capabilities. These limitations restrict the applications that WBANs can support. To enhance the capabilities of WBANs, the concept of cloud-assisted WBANs has been introduced recently. By using cloud computing technologies, cloud-assisted WBANs can provide more efficient processing of patients' physiology parameters and support richer services. In cloud-assisted WBANs, the data of patients' physiology are stored in the cloud. The integrity of the data is very important because these data will be used to provide a medical diagnosis and other medical treatments. To address the issue of integrity in cloud-assisted WBANs, we propose an efficient certificateless public auditing (CLPA) scheme. A security analysis of our proposed CLPA scheme shows that it is provably secure against two types of adversaries (i.e., a type-I adversary can replace users' public keys, and a type-II adversary can access the master key) in an environment of certificateless cryptography. A detailed performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed CLPA scheme yields better performance over a previously proposed CLPA scheme.",

      "abstract":"In recent years cloud computing provides a new way to address the constraints of limited energy, capabilities, and resources. Distributed hash table (DHT) based distributed networks have become increasingly important for efficient communication in large-scale cloud systems. Previous studies mainly focus on improving the performance such as latency, scalability and robustness, but seldom consider the security demands on the routing paths, for example, bypassing untrusted intermediate nodes. Inspired by Internet source routing, in which the source nodes specify the routing paths taken by their packets, this paper presents CSR, a tag-based, Classified Source Routing scheme in distributed networks to satisfy the security demands on the routing paths. Different from Internet source routing which requires some map of the overall network, CSR operates in a distributed manner where nodes with certain security level are tagged with a label and routing messages requiring that level of security are forwarded only to the qualified next-hops. We show how this can be achieved efficiently, by simple extensions of the traditional routing structures, and safely, so that the routing is uniformly convergent. The effectiveness of our proposals is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and extensive simulations.",

In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of wild type and loss-of-virulence mutant F. verticillioides co-expression networks to identify subnetwork modules that are associated with its pathogenicity. We constructed the F. verticillioides co-expression networks from RNA-Seq data and searched through these networks to identify subnetwork modules that are differentially activated between the wild type and mutant F. verticillioides, which considerably differ in terms of pathogenic potentials. A greedy seed-and-extend approach was utilized in our search, where we also used an efficient branch-out technique for reliable prediction of functional subnetwork modules in the fungus. Through our analysis, we identified four potential pathogenicity-associated subnetwork modules, each of which consists of interacting genes with coordinated expression patterns, but whose activation level is significantly different in the wild type and the mutant. The predicted modules were comprised of functionally coherent genes and topologically cohesive. Furthermore, they contained several orthologs of known pathogenic genes in other fungi, which may play important roles in the fungal pathogenesis.",

This has led to the proliferation of business critical applications that leverage various cloud platforms. Such applications hosted on single/multiple cloud provider platforms have diverse characteristics requiring extensive monitoring and benchmarking mechanisms to ensure run-time Quality of Service (QoS) (e.g., latency and throughput). This paper proposes, develops and validates CLAMBS-Cross-Layer Multi-Cloud Application Monitoring and Benchmarking as-a-Service for efficient QoS monitoring and benchmarking of cloud applications hosted on multi-clouds environments. The major highlight of CLAMBS is its capability of monitoring and benchmarking individual application components such as databases and web servers, distributed across cloud layers (*-aaS), spread among multiple cloud providers. We validate CLAMBS using prototype implementation and extensive experimentation and show that CLAMBS efficiently monitors and benchmarks application components on multi-cloud platforms including Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure.",

      "abstract":"Ultra-high dimensional variable selection has become increasingly important in analysis of neuroimaging data. For example, in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) study, neuroscientists are interested in identifying important biomarkers for early detection of the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using high resolution brain images that include hundreds of thousands voxels. However, most existing methods are not feasible for solving this problem due to their extensive computational costs. In this work, we propose a novel multiresolution variable selection procedure under a Bayesian probit regression framework. It recursively uses posterior samples for coarser-scale variable selection to guide the posterior inference on finer-scale variable selection, leading to very efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. The proposed algorithms are computationally feasible for ultra-high dimensional data. Also, our model incorporates two levels of structural information into variable selection using Ising priors: the spatial dependence between voxels and the functional connectivity between anatomical brain regions. Applied to the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) data in the ABIDE study, our methods identify voxel-level imaging biomarkers highly predictive of the ASD, which are biologically meaningful and interpretable. Extensive simulations also show that our methods achieve better performance in variable selection compared to existing methods.",

There are currently a number of de novo transcriptome assembly methods, but it has been difficult to evaluate the quality of these assemblies. In order to assess the quality of the transcriptome assemblies, we composed a workflow of multiple quality check measurements that in combination provide a clear evaluation of the assembly performance. We presented novel transcriptome assemblies and functional annotations for Pacific Whiteleg Shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei), a mariculture species with great national and international interest, and no solid transcriptome/genome reference. We examined Pacific Whiteleg transcriptome assemblies via multiple metrics, and provide an improved gene annotation. Our investigations show that assessing the quality of an assembly purely based on the assembler's statistical measurements can be misleading; we propose a hybrid approach that consists of statistical quality checks and further biological-based evaluations.",

      "abstract":"Determining gender by examining the human brain is not a simple task because the spatial structure of the human brain is complex, and no obvious differences can be seen by the naked eyes. In this paper, we propose a novel three-dimensional feature descriptor, the three-dimensional weighted histogram of gradient orientation (3D WHGO) to describe this complex spatial structure. The descriptor combines local information for signal intensity and global three-dimensional spatial information for the whole brain. We also improve a framework to address the classification of three-dimensional images based on MRI. This framework, three-dimensional spatial pyramid, uses additional information regarding the spatial relationship between features. The proposed method can be used to distinguish gender at the individual level. We examine our method by using the gender identification of individual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of a large sample of healthy adults across four research sites, resulting in up to individual-level accuracies under the optimized parameters for distinguishing between females and males. Compared with previous methods, the proposed method obtains higher accuracy, which suggests that this technology has higher discriminative power. With its improved performance in gender identification, the proposed method may have the potential to inform clinical practice and aid in research on neurological and psychiatric disorders.",

This spectrum can be partially supplied from existing neighboring communication networks (NCNs) via spectrum ordering. The scope of this paper is to propose a coexistence scheme, in which NCNs declare their own price per frequency channel and allow an SGCN to make decisions on the number of channels to be ordered. Due to dynamic NCN conditions and, accordingly, time-varying channel pricing, the spectrum ordering by an SGCN over a time horizon is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem. Having decoupled the problem over time, a dynamic spectrum allocation scheme is proposed. As a result of this scheme, the required data transmission rate of an SGCN is provided statistically. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme from the viewpoint of the grid operational cost.",

Our approach is based on the use of distributed data allocation among three independent servers and on a dynamic re-allocation of data at every access. Dynamic re-allocation is enforced by swapping data involved in an access across the servers in such a way that accessing a given node implies re-allocating it to a different server, then destroying the ability of servers to build knowledge by observing accesses. The use of three servers provides uncertainty, to the eyes of the servers, of the result of the swapping operation, even in presence of collusion among them.",

      "abstract":"With the exponential growth of data volume, big data have placed an unprecedented burden on current computing infrastructure. Dimensionality reduction of big data attracts a great deal of attention in recent years as an efficient method to extract the core data which is smaller to store and faster to process. This paper aims at addressing the three fundamental problems closely related to distributed dimensionality reduction of big data, i.e., big data fusion, dimensionality reduction algorithm and construction of distributed computing platform. A chunk tensor method is presented to fuse the unstructured, semi-structured and structured data as a unified model in which all characteristics of the heterogeneous data are appropriately arranged along the tensor orders. A Lanczos based high order singular value decomposition algorithm is proposed to reduce dimensionality of the unified model. Theoretical analyses of the algorithm are provided in terms of storage scheme, convergence property and computation cost. To execute the dimensionality reduction task, this paper employs the transparent computing paradigm to construct a distributed computing platform as well as utilizes a four-objectives optimization model to schedule the tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed holistic approach is efficient for distributed dimensionality reduction of big data.",

      "abstract":"Cloud computing, a distributed computing paradigm, enables delivery of IT resources over the Internet and follows the pay-as-you-go billing model. Workflow scheduling is one of the most challenging problems in cloud computing. Although, workflow scheduling on distributed systems like grids and clusters have been extensively studied, however, these solutions are not viable for a cloud environment. It is because, a cloud environment differs from other distributed environment in two major ways: on-demand resource provisioning and pay-as-you-go pricing model. Thus, to achieve the true benefits of workflow orchestration onto cloud resources novel approaches that can capitalize the advantages and address the challenges specific to a cloud environment needs to be developed. This work proposes a dynamic cost-effective deadline-constrained heuristic algorithm for scheduling a scientific workflow in a public cloud. The proposed technique aims to exploit the advantages offered by cloud computing while taking into account the virtual machine (VM) performance variability and instance acquisition delay to identify a just-in-time schedule of a deadline constrained scientific workflow at lesser costs. Performance evaluation on some well-known scientific workflows exhibit that the proposed algorithm delivers better performance in comparison to the current state-of-the-art heuristics.",

At present, some works explore this problem, but they often assume that only the nodes without messages probe the contacts. In this paper, we study the double probing problem. In particular, at time t, if a node has the message, it detects the contact with probability p(t). Otherwise, the probability is u(t). Then, this paper defines this problem as an optimization problem and solves it by Pontryagin's maximal principle. In addition, this paper proves that the both optimal policies conform to the threshold form. This result means that exploring the double probing policy is necessary.",

      "abstract":"Pathway analysis has been extensively applied to aid in the interpretation of the results of genome-wide transcription profiling studies, and has been shown to successfully find associations between the biological phenomena under study and biological pathways. There are two widely used approaches of pathway analysis: over-representation analysis, and gene set analysis. Recently genome-wide transcription factor binding data has become widely available allowing for the application of pathway analysis to this type of data. In this work, we developed regulatory enrichment pathway analysis (REPA) to apply gene set analysis to genome-wide transcription factor binding data to infer associations between transcription factors and biological pathways. We used the transcription factor binding data generated by the ENCODE project, and gene sets from the Molecular Signatures and KEGG databases. Our results showed that 54 percent of the predictions examined have literature support and that REPA's recall is roughly 54 percent. This level of precision is promising as several of REPA's predictions are expected to be novel and can be used to guide new research avenues. In addition, the results of our case studies showed that REPA enhances the interpretation of genome-wide transcription profiling studies by suggesting putative regulators behind the observed transcriptional responses.",

However, there are many security challenges which are particularly exacerbated by the multitenancy and virtualization features of cloud computing that allow sharing of resources among potentially untrusted tenants in access controlled cloud data centers. This can result in increased risk of data leakage. To address this risk vulnerability, we propose an efficient risk-aware virtual resource assignment mechanism for clouds multitenant environment. In particular, we introduce the notion of sensitivity in data centers and the objective is to minimize the risk of data leakage. In addition, the risk should not exceed in high sensitivity data centers in comparison to low sensitivity data centers. We present three assignment heuristics and compare their relative performance.",

      "abstract":"In order to improve simulation performance and to integrate simulation resources among geographically distributed locations, the concept of distributed simulation is proposed. Several types of distributed simulation standards, such as DIS and HLA, are established to formalize simulations and achieve reusability and interoperability of simulation components. To implement these distributed simulation standards and to manage the underlying system of distributed simulation applications, we employ grid computing and cloud computing technologies. These tackle the details of operation, configuration, and maintenance of simulation platforms in which simulation applications are deployed. However, for modelers who may not be familiar with the management of distributed systems, it is challenging to make a simulation-run-ready environment among different types of computing resources and network environments. In this article, a new multi-layered cloud-based scheme is proposed for enabling modeling and simulation based on different distributed simulation standards. This scheme is designed to ease the management of underlying resources and to achieve rapid elasticity that can provide unlimited computing capability to end users; it considers energy consumption, security, multi-user availability, scalability, and deployment issues. A mechanism for handling diverse network environments is described; by adopting it, idle public resources can be easily configured as additional computing capabilities for the local resource pool. A fast deployment model is built to relieve the migration and installation process of this platform. An energy-saving strategy is utilized to reduce the consumption of computing resources. Security components are implemented to protect sensitive information and block malicious attacks in the cloud. In the experiments, the proposed scheme is compared with its corresponding grid computing platform; the cloud computing platform achieves similar performance, but incorporates many advantages that the Cloud can provide.",

      "abstract":"With the rapid development of location-based services in mobile Internet, spatial keyword queries have been widely employed in various real-life applications in recent years. To realize the great flexibility and cost savings, more and more data owners are motivated to outsource their spatio-textual data services to the cloud. However, directly outsourcing such services to the untrusted cloud may arise serious privacy concerns. In this paper, we study the privacy-preserving top-$k$  spatial keyword query problem in untrusted cloud environments. Existing studies primarily focus on the design of privacy-preserving schemes for either spatial or keyword queries, and they cannot be applied to solve the privacy-preserving spatial keyword query problem. To address this problem, we present a novel privacy-preserving top-$k$  spatial keyword query scheme. In particular, we build an encrypted tree index to facilitate privacy-preserving top- $k$  spatial keyword queries, where spatial and textual data are encrypted in a unified way. To search with the encrypted tree index, we propose two effective techniques for the similarity computations between queries and tree nodes under encryption. To improve query performance on large-scale spatio-textual data, we further propose a keyword-based secure pruning method. Thorough analysis shows the validity and security of our scheme. Extensive experimental results on real datasets demonstrate our scheme achieves high efficiency and good scalability.",
